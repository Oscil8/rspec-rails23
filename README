Rails support for Rails 2.3.5

== DESCRIPTION:


== REQUIREMENTS:

* Ruby 1.8.6+
* Rails 2.3.5
* Rspec2

== ISSUES

* No support for pure Rails fixtures at all, and no plans to add it - we use Factory Girl/Fixture Replacement instead, so send a patch if you want support for this).
* No support for Rails integration tests -- use Cucumber (http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber) instead!
* No support for < 2.3.5 - it may work, it may not.  Not tested.

== CREDITS:

* RSpec for the great ideas and matchers
* Chad Humphries for Micronaut
* David Chelimsky and the Rspec-core team for Rspec
